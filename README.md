# Nurse Patient Assignment Project Frontend

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Introduction

I built this REACT application for my phase-3 project of Flatiron School software engineering flex pilot program. A user can view a list of nurses, or add a nurse to the unit. A user can also view a list of patients, or add a patient to the unit.

## Instructions

- Navigate to this folders directory. (frontend)
- Run 'npm start' or 'yarn start'. This will launch the server on localhost:3000, and should open the application in your web browser.
- Click on the Nurses tab of the navbar to view a list of nurses on the hypothetical unit. Here you can also add a nurse to the unit.
- Each nurse should have included which rooms they are currently assigned to. 
- Click on the Patients tab of the navbar to view a list of patients on the unit. Here you can also add a patient to the unit. 
- When adding a patient assign their nurse by looking at the nurse's badge number you would like to assign the patient to.
- You can also change which nurse a patient is assigned to by inputing the new nurses ID number in the designated form of the particular patient's card.


## Requirements

- Have npm or yarn installed 
- Have json-server installed

## Conclusion

This REACT application mimics a hospital units patient and nursing assignements. We are able to view all the patients on the unit, as well as add any new ones. We can see and change which nurse is assigned to each individual patient, and we can discharge a patient when they are able to leave the unit. We can also view a list of all the nurses on the unit. We can add a new nurse to the list. The list of nurses also includes which rooms they are currently assigned to.
